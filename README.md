# Triangle-Paint
A rudimentary paint program on a triangle grid. This was written when I had free time during an AP Computer Science A class. I used it to draw "impossible" shapes, but you can use it to draw anything.

# To run
One way that should always work is to simply `javac *.java` then `java Main.java`.

# To use
Left click to draw, right click to erase. Number keys to select color. Each stroke has a black border, but the triangle at the start of each stroke has its borders removed.
